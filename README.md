## Background of the Experiment

Data wrangling involves cleaning and organizing raw data for analysis, while data visualization creates graphical representations to reveal patterns and insights.

## Objectives of the Experiment

1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization

_Attached herewith is the Jupyter Notebook file where you can see the code for each problems._

## Problems
Download the attached ECE Board Exam 2 dataset named “**board2**” and save it to your default user folder.

**ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM:** Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.

### **PROBLEM 1**

Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas
Output: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P1.py
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/058140c9-1571-4801-81a1-86c15b03ab38)
a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon

b. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female

### **PROBLEM 2**
Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does
chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?

2. Jupyter Notebook

### Executing the Program
1. **Import Numpy** - Importing `Numpy` for numerical computations 
```
import numpy as np
```

2. **Import Pandas** - Importing `Pandas` for data structure manipulations and operations
```
import pandas as pd
```

3. **Matplotlib** - Importing `Matplotlib` for visualization
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

4. **`Shift + Enter`** - To run the code, press `Shift + Enter` while the cell is selected, or click the `Run` button in the notebook toolbar. You will see the output below the cell.
